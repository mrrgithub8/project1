<p>Lately I have had a couple of systems where the boot partition got corrupted or it's contents
deleted mistakenly. Even though I could not boot the system, I did not want to reinstall the whole
system and recover the data from backups.
 
So here is a quick solution that worked both on a SUSE 9.3 and a CentOS 5.4 system.

1. Boot the computer into rescue mode with the relevant CD/DVD by typing "linux rescue" at the boot prompt.

2. Mount the / partition of the system. On CentOS this is automatically done and the / is mounted on /mnt/sysimage.

Otherwise just do (assuming the root partition is on /dev/sda2)</p>
